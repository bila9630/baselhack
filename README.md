# BaselHack 2024

## Explanation

Our code is separated into frontend and backend folders.

Frontend is an Angular application that displays the user interface and send user input to the backend.

Backend is a Flask application that receives the user input and forwards it to the OpenAI API.

Both applications are deployed on Vercel.

Backend: https://baselbackend.vercel.app/apidocs/

Frontend: https://chatton-assure.vercel.app/chat

If you have documentation about the code (e.g. UML Diagrams, a readme etc.), that should go into the `documentation` directory.

If you have assets (like videos, presentations etc.), this can go into the `assets` directory.

You can use the MIT license in this template. Make sure to adjust the copy right holders in the placeholder `<copyright holder>` and add every team member to it.
You are also free to choose any other license - depending on the consensus of your team.

Thanks a lot!
